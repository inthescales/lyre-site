<h1 id="about-lyres-dictionary">About Lyre’s Dictionary</h2>

<p>Lyre’s Dictionary is a computer program written by me, <a href="http://www.inthescales.com/">Robin Hill</a>. It generates dictionary entries for made-up but etymologically plausible English words, based on how actual words are formed.</p>

<p>I originally created it for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/procjam">PROCJAM</a> in 2018, and have been periodically adding to it since then.</p>

<p>The program is written in Python, operating on a hand-made corpus of annotated word-elements, combining them and
modifying their sounds and forms based on my own understanding of how English came to be. It does not scrape a corpus of texts or use any AI / machine learning techniques, because I am interested in understanding and playing with the turns of English word-formation for myself as much as in the results.</p>

<p>The program's code is <a href="https://github.com/inthescales/lyres-dictionary">open source</a>, and is licensed under the MIT License.</p>
