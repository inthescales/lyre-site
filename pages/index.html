<p>Lyreâ€™s Dictionary is a computer program that generates novel English words based on existing roots and patterns. For example:</p>

<script src="assets/scripts/scripts.js"></script>
<script>
	example = choose_example()
    document.write(format_entry(example[0], example[1], example[2]));
</script>

<p>It also exists as a bot account on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/lyresdictionary">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://botsin.space/@lyresdictionary">Mastodon</a>, where it posts several new words every day.</p>
