The Lyre's Dictionary word feeds on [Twitter](https://x.com/lyresdictionary) and [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@lyresdictionary/)
now include words based on Old English roots. Some of these roots will be familiar, some are obscure, and others have long fallen
out of use in English, but all have precedent in the Old English period (before ~1200 AD), with most being of Germanic origin.

Some examples:

<div class="excerpt">
    <p>
        <span class="title">bewark</span> &#183; <i>verb</i><br>
        <span class="body">to bring about pains, aches in someone</span>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="excerpt">
    <p>
        <span class="title">flought</span> &#183; <i>noun</i><br>
        <span class="body">agitation or excitement</span>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="excerpt">
    <p>
        <span class="title">forthrow</span> &#183; <i>verb</i><br>
        <span class="body">to throw away</span>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="excerpt">
    <p>
        <span class="title">wanklesome</span> &#183; <i>adj</i><br>
        <span class="body">weak or unreliable</span>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="excerpt">
    <p>
        <span class="title">wriel</span> &#183; <i>noun</i><br>
        <span class="body">a veil or covering</span>
    </p>
</div>

While I wasn't able to add everything I wanted to this new system yet, I'm pleased with how the new words are turning out so far. I hope you will enjoy them.
