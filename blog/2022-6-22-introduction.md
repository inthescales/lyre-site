description: "A brief introduction to this blog."
---

I've done a lot of work on Lyre's Dictionary over the last few years, but I've expressed
very little of my thinking about it to others. What I have shared has mostly been in the
form of short Twitter threads, which are easily lost and not a very convenient format
for longer explanation.

So, I've created this blog with the intention of using it to communicate more about this
project that is dear to me. I'll talk about the mechanics of the program, the thoughts and decisions that have shaped the way it works, and my hopes for its future.

I hope it will be of interest to people, including those who don't have any knowledge
or interest in computer programming – few entries should require any technical background. You can follow future updates using the links to the side of the page.
