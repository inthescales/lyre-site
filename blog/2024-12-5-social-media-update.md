I've made a couple of updates to the places on social media where you can read from Lyre's Dictionary.

First, I've created [a bot account on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lyresdictionary.com), posting the same words as the accounts on other platforms.

Second, due to the shutdown of botsin.space, the Mastodon instance that the Lyre's Dictionary bot had been running on, I've had to migrate the account. It is now running at [@lyresdictionary@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@lyresdictionary).

I give my gratitude to [Colin "Muffinista" Mitchell](https://muffinlabs.com/) for running the botsin.space server for so long.
