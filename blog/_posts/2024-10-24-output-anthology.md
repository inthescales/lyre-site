Lyre's Dictionary is going to be included in an upcoming book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262549813/output/"><i>Output: An Anthology of Computer-Generated Text, 1953-2023</i></a>, edited by Lillian-Yvonne Bertram and Nick Montfort.

I'm honored for Lyre's Dictionary to have been selected — I think it's pretty special, and I'm glad if other people see value in it as well. I look forward to seeing how the book presents it, and how it and the other selections contextualize one another.
