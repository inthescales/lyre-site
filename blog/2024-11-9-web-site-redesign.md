I've given the Lyre's Dictionary web site a fresh design, which I think is more visually pleasing, along with some behind-the-scenes technical changes that I hope will make it easier for me to maintain. If you're not already looking at it, go check it out!

The only change in the site's content is that you will now see a 'word of the day' at the top of every page. These are chosen from recent words posted to the social media bot feeds, based on popularity. The intention is for this to act as a sort of Lyre's Dictionary 'highlight reel'. 

As well as displaying the word of the day on the web site, I've also added [an RSS feed](http://www.lyresdictionary.com/wotd-feed.xml) that publishes each day's word. With this, it is now possible to read from Lyre's Dictionary outside of any social media site.

I hope you will enjoy it!
