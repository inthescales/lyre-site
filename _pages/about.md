Lyre's Dictionary is a computer program written by me, [Robin Hill](http://www.inthescales.com/). It generates dictionary entries for novel, etymologically plausible English words based on existing roots and meanings.

I originally created it for [PROCJAM](https://itch.io/jam/procjam) in 2018, and have been continually adding to it since then. I intend to continue working on it whenever I have the time and inclination.

Lyre's Dictionary is written in Python, operating on a hand-made corpus of annotated word-elements that it combines according to simple rules. It does not use any machine learning techniques, because that is boring to me.
