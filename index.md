Lyre's Dictionary is a computer program that generates novel English words based on existing roots and patterns. For example:

<div class="excerpt">
    <p>
        <span class="title">cogniture</span> &#183; <i>noun</i>
        <br>
        <span class="body">The result of knowing</span>
    </p>
</div>

It also exists as a bot on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lyresdictionary) and on [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@lyresdictionary), where it posts several new words every day.
