Lyre's Dictionary is a computer program written by me, [Robin Hill](http://www.inthescales.com/).

I originally created it for [PROCJAM](https://itch.io/jam/procjam) in 2018, and have been continually adding to it since then.

I intend to continue working on it as there are many additions I would like to make, though I have no particular schedule for this. I may continue working on it until I die.

I intend to write more about the technical workings of Lyre's Dictionary, and my thoughts about it, but for now I will just say that it is written in Python, operating on a hand-made corpus of annotated word-elements that it combines according to simple rules. It does not use any machine learning techniques, because that boring to me.
